## Description

_A web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:_

Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."

These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program,

A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.  The user might have to refresh page if website doesn't perform as expected.
